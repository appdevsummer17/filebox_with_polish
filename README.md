# Filebox Final

In this project, we'll practice using Bootstrap and layering on our own additional styles.

## [Here is your target.](https://filebox-final-target.herokuapp.com/landing.html)

## Setup

 1. Create a Cloud 9 workspace as usual.
 1. `bin/setup`
 1. Run Project.
 1. Open the app in a Chrome tab.
 1. Open `public/index.html` in the editor.

## Suggested Steps

The starting point of this project is the target of and a solution to the last project, Filebox with Only Bootstrap; and your goal is now to write a few custom lines of CSS to give it that last bit of polish to really make it shine, and look almost exactly like the real [dropbox.com](https://www.dropbox.com/).

Write additional CSS rules in `additional_styles.css` and apply them to your elements. You may have to add additional `div`s or other elements to your HTML as well.

It takes surprisingly few lines of custom CSS to match our target.
